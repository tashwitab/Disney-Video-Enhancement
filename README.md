# 🎬 Disney Video Enhancement using ESRGAN and YOLOv5

This project focuses on enhancing the quality of low-resolution Disney animation videos using **ESRGAN (Enhanced Super-Resolution GAN)** and detecting key objects using **YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once)**.

It aims to improve visual quality for legacy animation content while showcasing real-time object detection performance.

## ✨ Features

- Super-resolution enhancement of animated Disney video clips
- Object detection on frames using pretrained YOLOv5
- Side-by-side visual comparison of low-res vs enhanced output
- Export of annotated video files
- Metrics: SSIM, Precision, Recall, FPS, Output Size

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Deep Learning Models**: ESRGAN, YOLOv5
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, OpenCV
- **Environment**: Google Colab / Python 3.x
- **Output**: Enhanced videos with bounding boxes

---

## 📂 Dataset

- [Disney Video Generation Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/domi2314/disney-videogeneration-dataset) from Kaggle
- Includes short, low-resolution animated clips of Disney characters

---

## 🧪 Workflow

1. Load and preprocess Disney video clips
2. Enhance frames using ESRGAN
3. Detect objects using YOLOv5
4. Annotate and compile final output video
5. Compute evaluation metrics (SSIM, precision, etc.)

## 🖼️ Sample Outputs

_Add screenshots or a link to a demo video here._

---

## 🚀 Future Work

- Fine-tune YOLOv5 for specific Disney characters
- Use Real-ESRGAN or SwinIR for further enhancement
- Deploy model as a web or mobile app
- Add background music reconstruction (audio enhancement)
